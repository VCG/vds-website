## IMPORTANT DATES

* **July 1, 2015 5:00pm PST:** Submission of Short Papers  (4-6 pages) and Posters
* September 4, 2015: Author Notification
* September 18, 2015: Camera Ready Submission and Copyright Forms


## Format

The symposium will feature a series of invited presentation by leading data scientists covering a wide range of visualization in data science. In addition, there will be short paper presentations and a poster session.

## Papers

Paper submissions should be 4-6 pages and describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage papers that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery. Papers will be published on the symposium website.

## Posters

Submissions consist of a brief 250-word abstract and supporting image that summarize your work. You must present a corresponding poster during the designated poster session, and are encouraged to incorporate a demo or video into your presentation. You also have the opportunity to give a brief oral preview during a plenary ‘fast forward’ session. We encourage submission of work in progress and preliminary results, previously published work from other venues, and visualization challenges relevant to Data Science.

## Review Process

Paper submissions will be managed by the Program Chairs and sent to external reviewers to evaluate the work’s novelty and significance. You have the option to have your work reviewed via a double-blind process; to do this, simply be sure to exclude all identifying information in the submitted manuscript file, ensuring that the reviewers will not know the identify of the authors. Otherwise, the review process will be single-blind, i.e. the reviewers will know the identity of the authors, but the authors will not know the identity of the reviewers.

Poster submissions will be reviewed for relevance and interest to the Data Science community by the Program Chairs.
