        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> From a wider perspective, Data Science be seen as the management and interpretation of data through computation and statistics. This tutorial highlights several of these core elements through an interactive computational workshop. To work with data, we need to access a data source, whereafter the data can be visualized to explore its structure. Based on intuitions gained about this structure, exploratory statistical analyses can then be made. Finally, more sophisticated machine learning models can be ﬁt to the data to draw inferences and make predictions about data yet unseen. This tutorial systematically leads attendees through these steps by way of practical, real-world examples, augmented by hands-on computations in the Python language.

        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Modern science is driven by computers (computational science) and data (data-driven science). While visual analysis has always been an integral part of science, in the context of computational science and data-driven science it has gained new importance. In this talk I will demonstrate novel approaches in visualization to support the process of modeling and simulations. Especially, I will report on some of the latest approaches and challenges in modeling and reasoning with uncertainty. Visual tools for ensemble analysis, sensitivity analysis, and the cognitive challenges during decision making build the basis of an emerging field of visual data science which is becoming an essential ingredient of computational thinking.

    <div class="tbioabstract">

        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> While visualizations are often used to convey research results or tell data-driven stories, they can also be powerful tools for discovery. General visualization tools typically require manual specification of views: analysts must select data variables and then choose which transformations and visual encodings to apply. While well-suited to answering targeted questions, this interaction model may impose a tedious specification process that impedes broad consideration of the data, particularly in the early stages of analysis. In this talk, I will present our work designing tools for more comprehensive and efficient data exploration. Our primary approach is to develop mixed-initiative systems for steerable, interactive browsing of recommended visualizations, chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures.

        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Population-level public health entails many spatial and temporal challenges. Questions often arise about which spatio-temporal factors, from a slew of environmental, medical and other variables, affect health outcomes. Additionally there are issues of privacy, noise and resolution which must all be considered. Further, when thinking about how to action on and improve health outcomes, this information must be communicated to diverse parties. In this talk I will describe the goals and audiences involved in public health, survey efforts of how visualization is used in public health, and articulate areas where there is room for improved work in visualization.

    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Buses are the main source of public transportation of the city of Rio de Janeiro, having around 100 million passengers every month. Recently, the city hall of Rio de Janeiro released the real-time GPS coordinates of all their operating public buses. The system generates almost 1 million GPS entries every day, but a reasonable amount of them are outliers - i.e. trajectories that do not follow their expected behavior. In this paper we present RioBusData, a tool that help users identify and understand, through different visualizations, the behavior of outlier buses that were automatically detected by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). RioBusData enables a better comprehension of the flow and service of outlier buses in Rio, and collaterally improves the understanding of Rio'۪s main source of transportation as a whole.</div>

        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> How to store, process, and analyze large heterogeneous data is a fundamental challenge. In particular, it is important to support interactive analysis over such data, while reducing query latency and improving system throughput. We extend the concept of online aggregation to online analytics, and enable the support for interactive query conditions as well. Our goal is to provide query and analytical results continuously from the start of the query and analytical task execution, while providing quality guarantees and refining the query accuracy throughout the query execution. We implemented our system based on both traditional relational database engine and NoSQL system. When exact results are required for interactive query execution over big data, we introduce an in-memory interactive query and analytical engine based on Spark SQL that supports rich query semantics and analytics through both SQL and DataFrame APIs.

    <div><span class="tspeaker">Dominik Jaekle, Bum Chul Kwon, Daniel A. Keim</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> The visual exploration of large data spaces often requires zooming and panning operations to obtain details. However, drilling down to see details results in the loss of contextual overview. Existing overview-plus-detail approaches provide context while the user examines details, but typically suffer from distortion or overplotting. This is why, there is great potential for off-screen visualization. Off-screen visualization is a family of techniques which provide data-driven context with the aid of visual proxies. Visual proxies can be visually encoded and adapted to the necessary data context with respect to scalability and visualization of high dimensional data. In this paper, we uncover the potential of off-screen visualization in visual data exploration by introducing its application examples to different domains through three derived scenarios. Furthermore, we categorize supporting tasks of off-screen visualizations and show areas of improvement. Then, we derive research challenges of off-screen visualizations and draw our perspectives on the issues for future research. This paper will provide guidance for future researchers on off-screen visualization techniques in visual data analysis.</div>

    <div class="ttitle">Paper: Comparing Dimensionality Reduction Methods Using Data Descriptor Landscapes</div>
    <div><span class="tspeaker">Bastian Rieck, Heike Leitte</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are commonly used in data science to turn high-dimensional data into 2D representations. Since data sets contain different structural features that need to be preserved by this process, there is a multitude of DR methods, each geared towards preserving a different aspect. This makes choosing a suitable algorithm for a given data set a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of DR methods based on how well their embedding preserves structural features in the high-dimensional point cloud. To this end, we develop a set of data descriptors that assess local and global structural features of point clouds. These features are computed for the high-D point cloud and the 2D embedding. We then use persistent homology to robustly compare the feature functions. An interactive landscape of the data descriptors, based on their topological differences, permits visually exploring the embeddings and their quality. We demonstrate the utility of our workflow by analysing multiple embeddings on high-dimensional data sets from real-world applications.</div>

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> How is celebrity status or popularity related to performance in sports? This initial question lead to the acquisition and analysis of large amounts of data regarding the performance of tennis players and the amount of public attention paid to them.   In this paper we will explore the relationship between discoveries from this data and the visualization tools used to reveal them throughout the project. There were three steps of visual inquiry that followed one another organically: First, we created diagrams to help answering 'who' questions, in the sense that whose popularity does (or not) follow the trajectory of their performance. Then we needed diagrams to answer the 'why' questions as in why different athletes' careers would proceed differently. Finally we developed a tool to combine and connect the various visual forms to gain a deeper understanding of the entirety of the data set and we plan to use this tool to explore similar data sets in the future.</div>

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> There are many applications of text classification such as gender attribution in market research or the identification of forged product reviews on e-commerce sites. Although several automatic methods provide satisfying performance in most application cases, we see a gap in supporting the analyst to understand the results and derive knowledge for future application scenarios. In this paper, we present a visualization driven application that allows analysts to gain insight in text classification tasks such as sentiment detection or authorship attribution on feature level, built with a practitioner'۪s way of reasoning in mind, the Text Classification Analysis Process.</div>
