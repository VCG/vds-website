    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will explore how players perform, both individually and as a team, on a basketball court. By blending advanced spatio-temporal models with geography-inspired mapping tools, we are able to understand player skill far better than either individual tool allows. Using optical tracking data consisting of hundreds of millions of observations, I will demonstrate these ideas by characterizing defensive skill and decision making in NBA players.

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Population-level public health entails many spatial and temporal challenges. Questions often arise about which spatio-temporal factors, from a slew of environmental, medical and other variables, affect health outcomes. Additionally there are issues of privacy, noise and resolution which must all be considered. Further, when thinking about how to action on and improve health outcomes, this information must be communicated to diverse parties. In this talk I will describe the goals and audiences involved in public health, survey efforts of how visualization is used in public health, and articulate areas where there is room for improved work in visualization.

<div class="tbioabstract">

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> While visualizations are often used to convey research results or tell data-driven stories, they can also be powerful tools for discovery. General visualization tools typically require manual specification of views: analysts must select data variables and then choose which transformations and visual encodings to apply. While well-suited to answering targeted questions, this interaction model may impose a tedious specification process that impedes broad consideration of the data, particularly in the early stages of analysis. In this talk, I will present our work designing tools for more comprehensive and efficient data exploration. Our primary approach is to develop mixed-initiative systems for steerable, interactive browsing of recommended visualizations, chosen according to statistical and perceptual measures.

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> How to store, process, and analyze large heterogeneous data is a fundamental challenge. In particular, it is important to support interactive analysis over such data, while reducing query latency and improving system throughput. We extend the concept of online aggregation to online analytics, and enable the support for interactive query conditions as well. Our goal is to provide query and analytical results continuously from the start of the query and analytical task execution, while providing quality guarantees and refining the query accuracy throughout the query execution. We implemented our system based on both traditional relational database engine and NoSQL system. When exact results are required for interactive query execution over big data, we introduce an in-memory interactive query and analytical engine based on Spark SQL that supports rich query semantics and analytics through both SQL and DataFrame APIs.

<div class="tbioabstract">

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Modern science is driven by computers (computational science) and data (data-driven science). While visual analysis has always been an integral part of science, in the context of computational science and data-driven science it has gained new importance. In this talk I will demonstrate novel approaches in visualization to support the process of modeling and simulations. Especially, I will report on some of the latest approaches and challenges in modeling and reasoning with uncertainty. Visual tools for ensemble analysis, sensitivity analysis, and the cognitive challenges during decision making build the basis of an emerging field of visual data science which is becoming an essential ingredient of computational thinking.

<div class="tbioabstract">

    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Increasingly, large corporations are building data science and engineering teams. These teams can be differentiated from traditional analytics teams in several ways including that they tend to run more like software engineering teams, that the methods and the practices often use open source technology, and that they are focused not solely on providing insights to the organization but also in building data products.  News Corp is an interesting place to work because its history is in journalism and publishing, and the ways that data science and journalism intersect plays out in different ways including data-driven decision making in the news room, building sustainable business models for journalism and story-telling with data. Also most relevant to this conference are ways in which data visualization is used to communicate to internal business stakeholders for decision-making purposes, as well as to our readership.
