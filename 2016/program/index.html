    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper we propose a service-oriented architecture that provides visualization of clinical data of patient population as a service. We derived a service model including essential information of visualization transformation and developed a service manager based on the model to interface between clinical applications and visualization resources. The proposed framework was implemented in development environment at Intermountain Healthcare to be connected with our internal clinical applications. It demonstrated that the applications benefit by standardization and reuse of the services, elimination of duplicated development, use case of shared visualization between researchers, and enhanced security control.</div>

    <div><span class="tspeaker">Aline Bessa, Fernando de Mesentier Silva, Rodrigo Frassetto Nogueira, Enrico Bertini, Juliana Freire</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Buses are the main source of public transportation of the city of Rio de Janeiro, having around 100 million passengers every month. Recently, the city hall of Rio de Janeiro released the real-time GPS coordinates of all their operating public buses. The system generates almost 1 million GPS entries every day, but a reasonable amount of them are outliers - i.e. trajectories that do not follow their expected behavior. In this paper we present RioBusData, a tool that help users identify and understand, through different visualizations, the behavior of outlier buses that were automatically detected by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). RioBusData enables a better comprehension of the flow and service of outlier buses in Rio, and collaterally improves the understanding of Rio'۪s main source of transportation as a whole.</div>

    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Understanding of data quality is essential for choosing suitable analysis methods and interpreting their results. Investigation of quality of movement data, due to their spatio-temporal nature, requires consideration from multiple perspectives at different scales. We review the key properties of movement data and, on their basis, create a typology of possible data quality problems and suggest approaches to identifying these types of problems.</div>

        <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will explore how players perform, both individually and as a team, on a basketball court. By blending advanced spatio-temporal models with geography-inspired mapping tools, we are able to understand player skill far better than either individual tool allows. Using optical tracking data consisting of hundreds of millions of observations, I will demonstrate these ideas by characterizing defensive skill and decision making in NBA players.

    <div class="ttitle">Paper: Off-Screen Visualization Perspectives: Tasks and Challenges</div>
    <div><span class="tspeaker">Dominik Jaekle, Bum Chul Kwon, Daniel A. Keim</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> The visual exploration of large data spaces often requires zooming and panning operations to obtain details. However, drilling down to see details results in the loss of contextual overview. Existing overview-plus-detail approaches provide context while the user examines details, but typically suffer from distortion or overplotting. This is why, there is great potential for off-screen visualization. Off-screen visualization is a family of techniques which provide data-driven context with the aid of visual proxies. Visual proxies can be visually encoded and adapted to the necessary data context with respect to scalability and visualization of high dimensional data. In this paper, we uncover the potential of off-screen visualization in visual data exploration by introducing its application examples to different domains through three derived scenarios. Furthermore, we categorize supporting tasks of off-screen visualizations and show areas of improvement. Then, we derive research challenges of off-screen visualizations and draw our perspectives on the issues for future research. This paper will provide guidance for future researchers on off-screen visualization techniques in visual data analysis.</div>

<div class="talk">
    <div class="ttitle">Paper: Comparing Dimensionality Reduction Methods Using Data Descriptor Landscapes</div>
    <div><span class="tspeaker">Bastian Rieck, Heike Leitte</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are commonly used in data science to turn high-dimensional data into 2D representations. Since data sets contain different structural features that need to be preserved by this process, there is a multitude of DR methods, each geared towards preserving a different aspect. This makes choosing a suitable algorithm for a given data set a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of DR methods based on how well their embedding preserves structural features in the high-dimensional point cloud. To this end, we develop a set of data descriptors that assess local and global structural features of point clouds. These features are computed for the high-D point cloud and the 2D embedding. We then use persistent homology to robustly compare the feature functions. An interactive landscape of the data descriptors, based on their topological differences, permits visually exploring the embeddings and their quality. We demonstrate the utility of our workflow by analysing multiple embeddings on high-dimensional data sets from real-world applications.</div>

    <div class="ttitle">Paper: Comprehension of data/model differences through diagrammatic reasoning</div>
    <div><span class="tspeaker">Kim Frederic Albrecht, Burcu Yucesoy</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> How is celebrity status or popularity related to performance in sports? This initial question lead to the acquisition and analysis of large amounts of data regarding the performance of tennis players and the amount of public attention paid to them.   In this paper we will explore the relationship between discoveries from this data and the visualization tools used to reveal them throughout the project. There were three steps of visual inquiry that followed one another organically: First, we created diagrams to help answering 'who' questions, in the sense that whose popularity does (or not) follow the trajectory of their performance. Then we needed diagrams to answer the 'why' questions as in why different athletes' careers would proceed differently. Finally we developed a tool to combine and connect the various visual forms to gain a deeper understanding of the entirety of the data set and we plan to use this tool to explore similar data sets in the future.</div>

    <div class="ttitle">Paper: Feature-Based Visual Exploration of Text Classification</div>
    <div><span class="tspeaker">Florian Stoffel, Lucie Flekova, Daniela Oelke, Iryna Gurevych, Daniel A. Keim</span></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tabstract"><b>Abstract:</b> There are many applications of text classification such as gender attribution in market research or the identification of forged product reviews on e-commerce sites. Although several automatic methods provide satisfying performance in most application cases, we see a gap in supporting the analyst to understand the results and derive knowledge for future application scenarios. In this paper, we present a visualization driven application that allows analysts to gain insight in text classification tasks such as sentiment detection or authorship attribution on feature level, built with a practitioner'۪s way of reasoning in mind, the Text Classification Analysis Process.</div>
