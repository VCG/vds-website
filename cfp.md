## Vision

Transformations in many fields are being enabled by rapid advances in our ability to acquire and generate data. The bottleneck to discovery is now our ability to analyze and make sense of heterogeneous, noisy, and often massive datasets. Extracting knowledge from this abundance of data lies at the heart of 21st century discovery. We truly are at the dawn of a revolutionary new era. 

Data science is the practice of deriving insight from data, at the intersection of the disciplines of statistical methodology, computer science, and one or more traditional scholarly fields. Data science includes the methodological fields of visualization, statistics, applied mathematics, data management, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It drives discoveries in business, economy, biology, medicine, environmental science, the physical sciences, the humanities and social sciences, and beyond. 

Visualization is an integral part of data science, and essential to enable sophisticated analysis of data. The first Symposium on Visualization in Data Science (VDS) at <a href="http://www.ieeevis.org/">IEEE VIS 2015</a> will bring together domain scientists and methods researchers (including data visualization, usability, data management, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, programming environments, scalable software). Our goal is to bring together practitioners and researchers in data science and visualization to discuss common interests, talk about practical issues, and identify open research problems.

Interested authors should submit a two-page abstract that describes the underlying problem, the proposed method, and preliminary results. Accepted poster abstracts will be included in the symposium proceedings. The format of the abstract will be the same as the format used for the regular paper submission. Poster authors are encouraged, but not required, to include a draft or sketch of the poster layout and content in their submission. This would help reviewers and show that the poster format is used effectively. The draft poster should be in PDF format. The authors should indicate if the poster would be accompanied by an on-site demonstration and/or videos.

## Format

The symposium will feature a series of invited presentation by leading data scientists covering a wide range of visualization in data science. In addition, there will be short paper presentations. Paper submissions should be 4-6 pages and describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage papers that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery.
